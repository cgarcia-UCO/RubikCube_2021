This repository is really an experiment intending to help students to design a code for solving the Rubik Cube

The idea is that students of the course Intelligent Systems of the University of CÃ³rdoba (2020_2021) iteratively update the code, to finally produce a software that reports the moves to solve the Rubik Cube. The solution should have been produced by a search method commented in the course.

# Important notes
* This repository uses the wonderfull https://github.com/davidwhogg/MagicCube for displaying and interacting with the Cube
* Submit your changes by "pull requests" with **small** pieces of code, and **once you have carried the test you think necessary**.
* The teacher will basically do nothing but test your code, by programming the corresponding test functions, and propose new steps with the goal of completing the code.
